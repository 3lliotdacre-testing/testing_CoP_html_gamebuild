**General Overview of project**
This is just me messing around no real world application and not intended for any external distribution. 
The project will contain a sprite tester branch and a game build branch 
everything is to run through html in a browser.
i only have stuff here so that it can be easily accessed by other systems.

at this stage 
- sprites are to always fit in a 450 x 450 pxl sprite box for ease of setup and running
- background images are fixed  3600x1350pxl
- example files are provided in each branch to make it easier for referencing what is needed and how it is needed
-----------------------------------------------
**Sprite Player tester branch**

does not pull files _CURRENTLY_ 
Requires spritesheet and config.json 





-----------------------------------------------

**Game branch**
For game build trialing making different components for practise 
pulls all files from the folder and subfolders exicuted from 
runs in html so it runs ona  browser
